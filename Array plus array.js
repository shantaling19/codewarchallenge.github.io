// DESCRIPTION:
// I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

// P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

// solution :

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
  
    let sum = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
      const arr1Value = arr1[i];
      const arr2Value = arr2[i];
      
      const addedValue = arr1Value + arr2Value;
    
       sum = sum + addedValue;
    }
    
    return sum;
  }
